The Variant Nowcast Hub uses Nextstrain clades, although model outputs, as shown in the model reports, are translated so that clades are matched with pango lineages. One reason the hub chose to use the Nextstrain clades as the grouping for the modeling is that the broader “clade” grouping allows for a smaller number of categories to be modeled in any given week compared with pango lineages, which do not have a similar high-level grouping.\nNextstrain provides an interactive phylogenetic tree for SARS-CoV-2, with Nextstrain clade labels annotating branches of the tree, and each sequence receiving both a pango lineage and Nextstrain clade assignment.\nThe following list provides a partial history of Nextstrain clade announcements, which include detailed discussion about the origin and genetic differences with other lineages and clades:\n\n24H (LF.7) and 24I (MV.1) (18 Oct 2024)\n24F (XEC) and 24G (KP.2.3) (25 Sep 2024)"

For this reason, the hub collects “nowcasts” (predictions for data relevant to times prior to the current time, but not yet observed) and some “forecasts” (predictions for future observations). Counting the Wednesday submission date as a prediction horizon of zero, we collect daily-level predictions for 10 days into the future (the Saturday that ends the epidemic week after the Wednesday submission) and -31 days into the past (the Sunday that starts the epidemic week four weeks prior to the Wednesday submission date). Overall, six weeks (42 days) of predicted values are solicited each week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCheck out the variant nowcasting hub repo for information about how to contribute predictions to the hub!"

Variants are labeled using both the correspnding Nextstrain clade and the associated pango lineage (e.g., “24A (JN.1)”). Recent observations are summaries of genomic sequence metadata from GenBank, made available as the “full open” datasets from Nextstrain. The points representing observed clade frequencies in a given week are transparent black dots. The size of the point corresponds to the total number of sequences (of all clades) in that state for that week (the specific number is visible when you hover on a specific point). Note that proportions from the most recently observed week are likely to change as new data arrives in future weeks. Points representing the clade proportion from each prediction model are shown as open circles of different colors. For simplicity, we show just the prediction from the Saturday from each week.
