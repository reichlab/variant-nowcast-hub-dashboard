# SARS-CoV-2 Variant Nowcast Hub Dashboard Repository

## How to generate a rebuild of the site

Any new commit will cause the website to rebuild. If you don't have a commit to make
you can open a new issue and then 
[add a new comment on an issue](https://github.com/reichlab/flusight-dashboard/issues/6#issuecomment-2504916376) 
with the words 
```
/hub build site
```

Further instructions about how the hubdashboard app works can be found at 
[the app website](https://github.com/apps/hubdashboard).

Build progress can be monitored at [the hub-dashboard-control-room Actions page](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hub-dashboard-control-room/actions).
