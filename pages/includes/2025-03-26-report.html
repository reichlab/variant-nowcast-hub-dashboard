<h2>Plots of data and nowcasts</h2>
<p>The interactive plots below summarize recent data and predictions of
SARS-CoV-2 clades. Variants are labeled using both the correspnding
Nextstrain clade and the associated pango lineage (e.g., “24A (JN.1)”).
Recent observations are summaries of genomic sequence metadata from
GenBank, made available as <a href="https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/ncov/en/latest/reference/remote_inputs.html#remote-inputs-open-files">the
“full open” datasets from Nextstrain</a>. The points representing
observed clade frequencies in a given week are transparent black dots.
The size of the point corresponds to the total number of sequences (of
all clades) in that state for that week (the specific number is visible
when you hover on a specific point). Note that proportions from the most
recently observed week are likely to change as new data arrives in
future weeks. Points representing the clade proportion from each
prediction model are shown as open circles of different colors. For
simplicity, we show just the prediction from the Saturday from each
week. The vertical gray line indicates the date on which submissions for
this round were due.</p>
